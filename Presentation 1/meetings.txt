10/9/14 After class @ SHU
Duration: 1 hour
We discussed on how we will do our unit testing
We also talked about the google maps testing.  Ali and Marlon will be working closely in the next few days.
We will also assume the queries communicating with the front page but prior to that, Ali will unit test the stored procedures
we may use ajax right away or place it next month.
Ali: Based of what I learned last night, this class isn't so much about having a clear picture on our goals but we are put in a real world situation where we must decide what tools to use to complete a job.  I have decided to focus more on the getting the job while learning as much as I can on these tools (agile, unit testing, user stories, code implementation, system level testing and deployment as well as git repository.

Ali:
Using Microsoft Project to keep our work items in check.  We do not have to use all its features but just enough to know what is a work item, who is working on it and how long it will take.  We may switch to https://taiga.io/ instead since its online and easier to work with

Talk about the point system created in agile project management detail txt file
Setup a process for automated unit testing
Get everyone familiar with filezilla to start dumping files onto the file server, access the URL and the pages online.  (i will send a video on how to connect later)

meeting went well. we talked about modifying the sprint 1 and 2 and all agreed to do so.
I (Ali) will be taking hte role of the control and writing .php functions.  I will have to break down some DBs and control functions into smaller parts.  In order words, sprint 2 will need some additional modification.
I will be adding some content into D:\school\shu-cs604\busroute\scrub_notes\ali_help.txt for the team to look into when building the UIs.
Marlon showed us the google api thats loaded in D:\school\shu-cs604\busroute\Website_Source_Files\Marlon\GoogleMapsAPI.html.
So at this point, Marlon and I (Ali) are done with our sprint 1.
As mentioned, Sprint 2 will need to be more detailed for us to successfully meet the sprints at a faster rate.
